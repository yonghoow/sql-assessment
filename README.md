# sql-assessment

Qn 2: First, use SELECT * from both tables and use your knowledge of queries and aggregate functions to get to know the data:

-What are the Top 25 schools (.edu domains)?
-How many .edu learners are located in New York?
-The mobile_app column contains either mobile-user or NULL. How many of these Codecademy learners are using the mobile app?

My Ans:
-- top 25 schools (.edu domains)
SELECT COUNT(user_id), email_domain 
FROM users 
GROUP BY email_domain
ORDER BY COUNT(user_id) DESC
LIMIT 25;

-- No. of learners in New York
SELECT COUNT (user_id) FROM users
WHERE city = 'New York';

-- No. of learners using mobile app
SELECT COUNT (user_id) FROM users
WHERE mobile_app = 'mobile-user';

Qn 3: Query for the sign up counts for each hour.

My Ans:
-- sign up counts for each hour
SELECT sign_up_at, strftime('%H', sign_up_at), 
COUNT(sign_up_at)
FROM users
GROUP BY strftime('%H', sign_up_at);

Qn 4: Join the two tables using JOIN and then see what you can dig out of the data!

- Do different schools (.edu domains) prefer different courses?
- What courses are the New Yorkers students taking?
- What courses are the Chicago students taking?

My Ans:
-- do different schools prefer different courses?

    WHEN progress.learn_cpp != ''
      THEN users.user_id END) AS cpp_enrolled,

Reflection questions:

1. What did you like about this project?

I like that I can do the assessment using the Codecademy website to test my sql queries.

2. What did you struggle with in this project?

I struggled with count() and joining tables at the beginning. 

3. What would make your experience with this assessment better?

I think nothing in this area. The experience is quite good.
